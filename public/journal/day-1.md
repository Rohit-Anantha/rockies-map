# Day 1: Austin to Lampasas

The air in Austin was thick with humidity and anticipation as we gathered at the UT Tower. After months of training, fundraising, and planning, the moment had finally arrived. With a chorus of "Texas!" and a thunderous "Fight!", we clipped in and began our 4,000-mile journey toward Anchorage.

The first few miles were a blur of cheering crowds and waving flags. Leaving the city limits felt surreal; the familiar skyline slowly faded in our rearview mirrors, replaced by the rolling hills of the Texas Hill Country. The heat began to climb early, reminding us that the road ahead would demand every ounce of our resilience.

As we pedaled toward Lampasas, the reality of the mission set in. We aren't just riding bikes; we are carrying the stories of those affected by cancer. Every pedal stroke today was dedicated to our friends, family, and strangers who have fought this battle. 

By the time we reached our first host site, our legs were heavy, but our spirits were soaring. We shared our first team meal on the road, reflecting on the miles covered and the thousands yet to come. Day one is in the books, and the road to Alaska has officially begun.
